     * not the system was going up to a level or coming down to
     * a level.
     * <p>
     * If the system was going up to a level then calling cancel
     * will cause the system to stop going up, and instead proceed
     * back down to the last completed level.  For example, suppose
     * there were three services at level ten and the system was
     * going up to level ten.  As the system was proceeding up to
     * level ten the first of the three services had already been
     * started and the second service was in progress and the third
     * service had not been started.  The system will wait for the second
     * service to complete coming up and then will shut it down along
     * with the first service.  Since the last completed level was nine,
     * the system will remain at level nine and this job will be complete.
     * <p>
     * If the system was going down to a level then calling cancel
     * will cause the system to continue going down, but it will stop
     * going down at the next level.  For example, suppose there were
     * three services at level ten and the current proposed level is
     * five.  Suppose one of those three services had already been shutdown
     * and one was in the process of being shutdown and the other had
     * not yet been shutdown when the cancel arrives.  The system will
     * continue to shutdown the one in progress and then will shutdown
     * the remaining service at level ten to reach level nine.  However,
     * the job will no longer attempt to go down to level five, but will
     * instead be finished at level nine.
     * <p>
     * There is a cancel timeout value that is set.  This is the amount
     * of time the system will wait for services to complete after
     * cancel has been called.  Any services still running after this
     * timeout will be orphaned (they will not be shutdown if they
     * do eventually complete).  Further, if an attempt is made to
     * start the same service that is still running on another thread
     * that request will fail.
